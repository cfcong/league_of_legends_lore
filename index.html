      <p>Along the western coast of Valoran, the human city-state of Demacia shines as the continent's paragon of virtue amongst all the other human settlements.The people of Demacia are driven by their common cause to disseminate benevolence and order for the betterment of all beings throughout Valoran. They view malice and selfishness as a disease which should be expunged from the psyche of humankind.</p>

      <p>The human city-state of Noxus is a settlement where the physically and mentally strong acquire power through any means, regardless of the consequences to their fellow citizens. Strength begets strength, at least as far as the humans of Noxus are concerned. As is naturally and necessarily the case with humankind, Noxus is an orderly city-state, where rules protect the citizenry from harmâ€¦ at least from their peers. In Noxus, however, those with power are clearly protected by the law more than those without it.</p>

      <p>Freljord, a frozen land in the northernmost reaches of Runeterra. Three great tribes vie for power over this inhospitable realm, each with their own agenda. As their armies gather under the clouds of a coming war, the three leaders rally the worlds greatest heroes to their respective banners.</p>

      <p>Piltover, also known as the City of Progress, is the leading center of ecologically-minded techmaturgical research on Valoran. The city's great academies and their contributions to science are known across the land, rivaled only by the eccentric colleges found in Zaun. With the current state of conflict in Valoran, scientists and denizens of the City of Progress have come together to work collectively in order to rectify the problems plaguing the continent</p>

      <p>Zaun is a city-state both supported and ruined by unchecked industry, mercantilism, and magic run amok. The pollution from the countless factories and laboratories is constantly spewed into the environment. To them, their right to do as they please is what makes Zaun the freest city-state on Runeterra. The Zaun is the anti-thesis of what Piltover is.</p>

      <p>The island city-state of Ionia is a haven for beings who seek spiritual evolution and enlightenment. While populated primarily by humans, some yordles and beings of unique origin also make Ionia their home.The Ionians dedicate their lives to pursuing spiritual enlightenment instead of conflict; what kind of enlightenment is up to the individual.Most Ionians find violence distasteful and try not to resort to using it when resolving issues. That does not mean, however, that they are helpless or unable to defend themselves.</p>

      <p>Bilgewater is vital stop for trade ships traveling near the Blue Flame Island. While this increased the nation's wealth and influence over Valoran, it has also made the city-state a major refuge for piracy, and the island itself a tempting target for pirate raids. Bilgewater is a relatively lawless city-state, particularly in the pirate-run slums. The majority of the city's denizens carry a variety of weapons, which range from cutlasses to pistols, in order to protect themselves at all times.</p>

      <p>Bandle City resides in Yordle Land and is the home city of the yordle race. The vast majority of the yordle society dwells in the southeastern part of Valoran, behind the safety of the Sablestone Mountain range. Yordles require far more social interaction with their own kind than humans do. They generally are a peaceful and amicable race; their moral compass is most often pointed toward goodness and benevolence.</p>
