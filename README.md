## Lighthouse Labs Final Project

I chose to do a front-end webpage for the assignment to furthur familiarize myself with CSS. However, I figured it would be an enjoyable challenge to build a webpage that contains parallax. This is my first parallax webpage; it follows a basic tutorial from [Webdesign Tuts+ - Create a Parallax Scrolling Website Using Stellar.js by Aaron Lumsden](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/complete-websites/create-a-parallax-scrolling-website-using-stellar-js/).
