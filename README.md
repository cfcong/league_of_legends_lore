## Lighthouse Labs Final Project

For my final project, I chose to do a front-end webpage to furthur familiarize myself with CSS. However, I wanted to create a webpage containing parallax scrolling (one of the few things that made me want to learn web development). This is my first parallax webpage; it follows a basic tutorial from [Webdesign Tuts+ - Create a Parallax Scrolling Website Using Stellar.js by Aaron Lumsden](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/complete-websites/create-a-parallax-scrolling-website-using-stellar-js/).
